Congratulations you have started your NETCONF/YANG Network
Programmability journey!

You can learn more about network programmability with NETCONF/YANG
[here](https://www.tail-f.com).

This was a very quick overview of how to do NETCONF/YANG
interoperability testing with Cisco NSO and DrNED Examiner, we hope
it gives you a small flavour of what the tools can do.

If you have not already seen our [Cisco DevNet
site](https://developer.cisco.com/site/nso/) it contains lots of
information as well as a way to download a development version of NSO,
with all the examples and full documentation.

There is also a thriving
[community](https://community.cisco.com/t5/nso-developer-hub-discussions/bd-p/5672j-disc-dev-nso)
where you can ask questions and get the latest information. Let us in
particular recommend these videos from our latest Developer Days
conference in Stockholm as a good place to get started
https://community.cisco.com/t5/nso-developer-hub-blogs/nso-developer-days-2018-video-links/ba-p/3682921.

Netsim is, of course, just ConfD, which is available for download
[here](https://www.tail-f.com/confd-basic/).

More NSO Katacoda demos and examples can be found at the
[Cisco-NSO](https://katacoda.com/cisco-nso) Katacoda landigng page.
